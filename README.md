# minic

Yet another C minifier using Clang-AST and (annoyingly) regex magic.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Support C++
- [ ] Investigate deeper into clang AST. (currently variables in nested function params are not renamed)
- [ ] Support minifying multiple source file
- [ ] Add rules to replace repetitive calls with macros
